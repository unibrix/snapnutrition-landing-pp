## What is SnapNutrition AI?

SnapNutrition AI lets you track calories and nutrition instantly using AI. Simply snap a photo of your food, scan a barcode, type, or speak — and get instant calorie and macro estimates. Log calories from your wrist with the Apple Watch app, or track at a glance with Home Screen, Lock Screen, and Control Center widgets.

**Completely free.** You bring your own API key (Anthropic Claude or OpenAI GPT) and pay only for what you use — typically just pennies per scan.
